	// ReadWrite enables reads and writes on a collection in a
	// transactional manner.  Specifically, all writes are applied
	// atomically, and writes are only applied if reads have not been
	// invalidated at the end of the transaction.  Basically, it's
	// software transactional memory.  See this blog post for details:

	// ReadWriteInt is the same as ReadWrite except that it operates on

// Index specifies a secondary index on a collection.
//
// Indexes are created in a transactional manner thanks to etcd's
// transactional support.
//
// A secondary index for collection "foo" on field "bar" will reside under
// the path `/foo__index_bar`.  Each item under the path is in turn a
// directory whose name is the value of the field `bar`.  For instance,
// if you have a object in collection `foo` whose `bar` field is `test`,
// then you will see a directory at path `/foo__index_bar/test`.
//
// Under that directory, you have keys that point to items in the collection.
// For instance, if the aforementioned object has the key "buzz", then you
// will see an item at `/foo__index_bar/test/buzz`.  The value of this item
// is empty.  Thus, to get all items in collection `foo` whose values of
// field `bar` is `test`, we issue a query for all items under
// `foo__index_bar/test`.
//
// Multi specifies whether this is a multi-index.  A multi-index is an index
// on a field that's a slice.  The item is then indexed on each element of
// the slice.
